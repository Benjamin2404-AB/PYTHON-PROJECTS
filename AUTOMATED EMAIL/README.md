NB:
Generated an app password from Gmail using the 'Allow less secure apps' option, which bypasses two-step verification. 
Note that this method is used for apps that don't support two-step verification. 
To maintain security, it's essential to use the same procedure to obtain a generated password from Gmail, as using your regular password may compromise your account's security
